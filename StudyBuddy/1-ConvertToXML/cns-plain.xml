DEVELOPMENTAL ANOMALIES 

I. NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS

A. Arise from incomplete closure of the neural tube

1. Neural plate invaginates early in gestation to form the neural tube, which runs 

along the cranial-caudal axis of the embryo.

2. The  wall of the neural tube forms central nervous system tissue, the hollow

lumen forms the ventricles and spinal cord canal, and the neural crest forms the
peripheral nervous system.

B. Associated with low folate levels prior to  conception
C. Detected during prenatal care by elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)  levels in the

amniotic fluid and maternal blood

D. Anencephaly is absence of the skull and brain (disruption of the cranial end of the

neural tube). 
1. Leads to a 'frog-like'  appearance of the fetus (Fig.  17.1) 
2. Results in  maternal polyhydramnios since fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid is 

impaired

E. Spina bifida is failure of the posterior vertebral arch to  close, resulting in a vertebral

defect (disruption of the caudal end of the neural tube). 
1. Spina bifida occulta presents as  a dimple or  patch of hair overlying the vertebral

defect.

2. Spina bifida presents with cystic protrusion of the underlying tissue through the

vertebral defect.
i. Meningocele - protrusion of meninges
ii. Meningomyelocele - protrusion of meninges and spinal cord

II. CEREBRAL AQUEDUCT STENOSIS

A. Congenital stenosis of the channel that drains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the 3rd 

ventricle into the 4th ventricle

B. Leads to accumulation of CSF in the ventricular space; most common cause of

hydrocephalus in newborns
1. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus lining the ventricles.
2. Flows from the lateral ventricles into the 3rd ventricle via the interventricular

foramen of Monro

3. Flows from the 3rd ventricle into the 4th ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct
4. Flows from the 4th ventricle into the subarachnoid space via the foramina of

Magendie and Luschka

C. Presents with enlarging head circumference due to  dilation of the ventricles (cranial

suture lines are not fused)

III. DANDY-WALKER MALFORMATION

A. Congenital failure of the cerebellar vermis to  develop 
B. Presents as a massively dilated 4th ventricle (posterior fossa) with an absent

cerebellum  (Fig.  17.2);  often accompanied by hydrocephalus

#


IV. ARNOLD-CHIARI MALFORMATION  (TYPE II)

A. Congenital downward displacement of cerebellar vermis and tonsils through the 

foramen magnum

B. Obstruction of CSF flow commonly results in hydrocephalus.
C. Often associated with meningomyelocele

SPINAL CORD LESIONS 
I. SYRINGOMYELIA
A. Cystic degeneration of the spinal cord 
B. Arises with trauma or in association with a type 1 Arnold-Chiari malformation
C. Usually occurs at  C8-Tl

1. Presents as  sensory loss of pain and temperature with sparing of fine touch 

and position sense in  the upper extremities ("cape like" distribution) - due to 
involvement of the anterior white commissure of the spinothalamic tract with 
sparing of the dorsal column (Table  17.1) 

D. Syrinx expansion results in  involvement of other spinal tracts leading to 

1. Muscle atrophy and weakness with decreased muscle tone and impaired 
reflexes - due to damage to  lower motor neurons of the anterior horn 

2. Horner syndrome with ptosis  (droopy eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and 
anhidrosis (decreased sweating) - due to  disruption of the lateral horn of the 
hypothalamospinal tract (Table  17.1) 

II.  POLIOMYELITIS

A. Damage to  the anterior motor horn due to  poliovirus infection
B. Presents with lower motor neuron signs - flaccid paralysis with muscle atrophy, 

fasciculations, weakness with decreased muscle tone,  impaired reflexes, and negative 
Babinski sign  (downgoing toes) 

III. WERDNIG-HOFFMAN DISEASE

A. Inherited degeneration of the anterior motor horn; autosomal recessive
B. Presents as  a "floppy baby;" death occurs within a few years after birth.

IV. AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS  (ALS) 

A. Degenerative disorder of upper and lower motor neurons of the corticospinal tract 

(Table  17.1) 
1. Anterior motor horn degeneration leads to  lower motor neuron signs - flaccid  
paralysis with muscle atrophy, fasciculations, weakness with decreased muscle 
tone,  impaired reflexes,  and negative  Babinski sign.

2.  Lateral corticospinal tract degeneration leads to  upper motor neuron signs -

spastic paralysis with hyperreflexia, increased muscle tone,  and positive Babinski
sign.

B. Atrophy and weakness of hands is an early sign.

1. Lack of sensory impairment distinguishes ALS from syringomyelia.

C. Most cases are sporadic, arising in  middle age adults.

1. Zinc-copper superoxide dismutase mutation (SOD1)  is present in  some

familial cases; leads to  free radical injury in  neurons

V. FRIEDREICH ATAXIA

A. Degenerative disorder of the cerebellum and spinal cord 
1. Degeneration of the cerebellum leads to  ataxia.
2. Degeneration of multiple spinal cord tracts leads to loss of vibratory sense and
proprioception, muscle weakness in the lower extremities, and loss of deep 
tendon reflexes.

B. Autosomal recessive; due to  expansion of an unstable trinucleotide repeat (GAA)  in 

the frataxin gene 
1. Frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron regulation; loss results in iron 

buildup with free radical damage.

C. Presents in early childhood; patients are wheelchair bound within a few years.
D. Associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

I. BASIC  PRINCIPLES

A. Inflammation of the leptomeninges (Fig.  17.3)

<page number="3">
MENINGITIS 

1. Meninges consist of three layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia)  that lie between the

brain and the skull.

2. Pia and arachnoid together are termed leptomeninges.

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

B. Most commonly due  to  an  infectious agent 

1. Group B streptococci, E coli, and Listeria monocytogenes (neonates) 
2. N meningitidis (children and teenagers), Streptococcus pneumoniae (adults and 

elderly),  and H influenza (nonvaccinated infants) 
3. Coxsackievirus (children; fecal-oral transmission) 
4. Fungi  (immunocompromised individuals) 

C. Presents with classic triad of headache, nuchal rigidity, and fever; photophobia, 

vomiting,  and altered mental status may also be  present. 
D. Diagnosis is made  by lumbar puncture  (sampling of CSF). 

1. Performed by placing a needle between L4  and L5  (level of the iliac crest). Spinal 

cord ends  at  L2,  but  subarachnoid space  and  cauda equina continue to  S2. 
2. Layers crossed include skin, ligaments, epidural space, dura,  and arachnoid. 

E. CSF  findings 

1. Bacterial meningitis - neutrophils with ↓ CSF glucose; gram stain and culture 

often identify the causative organism. 

2. Viral meningitis - lymphocytes with normal CSF  glucose 
3. Fungal meningitis - lymphocytes with ↓ CSF glucose 

F. Complications are usually seen with bacterial meningitis. 
1. Death - herniation secondary to  cerebral edema 
2. Hydrocephalus, hearing loss, and seizures - sequelae related to  fibrosis

<page number="4">
CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE 

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Neurologic deficit due  to  cerebrovascular compromise; major cause of morbidity and 

mortality

B. Due  to  ischemia (85%  of cases)  or  hemorrhage (15%  of cases) 

1. Neurons are dependent on  serum glucose as  an essential energy source  and are 
particularly susceptible to  ischemia (undergo necrosis within 3-5 minutes). 

II.  GLOBAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA 
A. Global ischemia to  the brain
B. Major etiologies 

1. Low perfusion (e.g.,  atherosclerosis) 
2. Acute decrease in  blood flow (e.g., cardiogenic shock) 
3. Chronic hypoxia (e.g.,  anemia) 
4. Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia (e.g., insulinoma) 

C. Clinical features are based on  duration and magnitude of the insult. 

1. Mild global ischemia results in  transient confusion with prompt recovery.

Wellmann, MD)

185

2. Severe global ischemia results in diffuse necrosis; survival leads to  a 'vegetative 

state.'

3. Moderate global ischemia leads to infarcts in watershed areas (e.g., area lying 

between regions fed by the anterior and middle cerebral artery)  and damage to 
highly vulnerable regions such as 
i. Pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex (layers 3,  5,  and 6) - leads to 

laminar necrosis

ii. Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus  (temporal lobe) - important in 

long-term memory

iii. Purkinje layer of the cerebellum - integrates sensory perception with 

motor control

III. ISCHEMIC STROKE

A. Regional ischemia to  the brain that results in  focal neurologic deficits lasting > 24 

hours
1. If symptoms last more than 24 hours, the event is termed a transient ischemic attack

(TIA). 

B. Subtypes include thrombotic, embolic, and lacunar strokes.

1. Thrombotic stroke is  due to  rupture of an  atherosclerotic plaque. 

i. Atherosclerosis usually develops at branch points (e.g., bifurcation of internal

carotid and middle cerebral artery in the circle of Willis). 
ii. Results in a pale infarct at the periphery of the cortex (Fig.  17.4) 

2. Embolic stroke is due to  thromboemboli.

i. Most common source of emboli is the left side of the heart (e.g.,  atrial

fibrillation).

ii. Usually involves the middle cerebral artery
iii. Results in a hemorrhagic infarct at the periphery of the cortex

3. Lacunar stroke occurs secondary to hyaline arteriolosclerosis, a complication of

hypertension.
i. Most commonly involves lenticulostriate vessels, resulting in  small cystic

areas of infarction  (Fig.  17.5) 
Involvement of the internal capsule leads to a pure motor stroke.
Involvement of the thalamus leads to a pure sensory stroke.

ii.
iii.

C. Ischemic stroke results in liquefactive necrosis.

1. Eosinophilic change in the cytoplasm of neurons  (red neurons, Fig.  17.6A)  is  an 

early microscopic finding (12  hours after infarction).

2. Necrosis  (24 hours), infiltration by neutrophils (days  1-3)  and microglial cells

(days 4-7), and gliosis (weeks 2-3) then ensue. 

3. Results in formation of a fluid-filled cystic space surrounded by gliosis (Fig. 17.6B)

B. Presents as a sudden headache ("worst headache of my life") with nuchal rigidity
C. Lumbar puncture shows xanthochromia (yellow hue due to bilirubin).
D. Most frequently (85%)  due to rupture of a berry aneurysm; other causes include AV 

malformations and an  anticoagulated state.
1. Berry aneurysms are thin-walled saccular outpouchings that lack a media layer

(Fig.  17.9),  increasing the risk for rupture.

2. Most frequently located in the anterior circle of Willis at branch points of the

anterior communicating artery

3. Associated with Marfan syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney

disease

TRAUMA 

I. EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

A. Collection of blood between the dura and the skull
B. Classically due to  fracture of the temporal bone with rupture of the middle

meningeal artery; bleeding separates the dura from the skull.
1. Lens-shaped lesion on  CT 
2. Lucid interval may precede neurologic signs.

C. Herniation is a lethal complication.

II. SUBDURAL HEMATOMA

A. Collection of blood underneath the dura; blood covers the surface of the brain (Fig. 

17.10). 

B. Due to  tearing of bridging veins that lie between the dura and arachnoid; usually

arises with trauma
1. Crescent-shaped lesion on  CT 
2. Presents with progressive neurologic signs

which stretches the veins
C.  Herniation is a lethal complication.

III. HERNIATION

A. Displacement of brain tissue due to  mass effect or  increased intracranial pressure
B. Tonsillar herniation involves displacement of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen

magnum.
1. Compression of the brain stem leads to  cardiopulmonary arrest.

C. Subfalcine herniation involves displacement of the cingulate gyrus under the falx

cerebri.
1. Compression  of the anterior cerebral artery leads to infarction.

D. Uncal herniation involves displacement of the temporal lobe uncus under the

tentorium cerebelli.
1. Compression of cranial nerve III  (oculomotor) leads to the eye  moving "down

and out" and a dilated pupil.

2. Compression of posterior cerebral artery leads to  infarction of occipital lobe 

(contralateral homonymous hemianopsia).

3. Rupture of the paramedian artery leads to  Duret (brainstem) hemorrhage.

DEMYELINATING DISORDERS 

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Myelin insulates axons, improving the speed and efficiency of conduction.

1. Oligodendrocytes myelinate the central nervous system.
2. Schwann cells myelinate the peripheral nervous system.

B. Demyelinating disorders are characterized by destruction of myelin or 

oligodendrocytes; axons are generally preserved.

II. LEUKODYSTROPHIES

A. Inherited mutations in enzymes necessary for production  or maintenance of myelin
B. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is due to  a deficiency of arylsulfatase (autosomal

recessive); most common leukodystrophy
1. Sulfatides cannot be degraded and accumulate in  the lysosomes of

oligodendrocytes (lysosomal storage disease).

C. Krabbe disease is due to  a deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (autosomal recessive). 

1. Galactocerebroside accumulates in  macrophages.

D. Adrenoleukodystrophy is  due to impaired addition of coenzyme A to  long-chain

fatty acids  (X-linked defect).

brain.

III. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

A. Autoimmune destruction of CNS myelin and oligodendrocytes

1. Most common chronic CNS disease of young adults (20-30 years of age); more 

commonly seen in women
2. Associated with HLA-DR2
3. More  commonly seen in regions away from the  equator

B. Presents with relapsing neurologic deficits with periods of remission (multiple 

lesions in time and space).  Clinical features include
1. Blurred vision in  one  eye  (optic nerve) 
2. Vertigo and scanning speech mimicking alcohol intoxication (brainstem)
3.
4. Hemiparesis or unilateral loss of sensation (cerebral white matter, usually 

Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (medial longitudinal fasciculus)

periventricular)

5. Lower extremity loss of sensation or weakness (spinal cord) 
6. Bowel, bladder,  and sexual dysfunction (autonomic nervous system) 

C. Diagnosis is made by MRI and lumbar puncture.

1. MRI reveals plaques (areas of white matter demyelination).
2. Lumbar puncture shows increased lymphocytes, increased immunoglobulins 

with oligoclonal IgG bands on  high resolution electrophoresis, and myelin basic 
protein.

D. Gross examination shows gray-appearing plaques in the white matter (Fig.  17.11). 
E. Treatment of acute attacks includes high-dose steroids.

1. Long-term treatment with interferon beta slows progression of disease.

IV. SUBACUTE SCLEROSING PANENCEPHALITIS

A. Progressive, debilitating encephalitis leading to  death
B. Due to  slowly progressing, persistent infection of the brain by measles virus.

1.

Infection occurs in  infancy; neurologic signs arise years later  (during childhood).

C. Characterized by viral inclusions within neurons (gray matter)  and 

oligodendrocytes (white matter) 

V. PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY

A. JC virus infection of oligodendrocytes (white matter)

1.

Immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS or leukemia) leads to  reactivation of the latent 
virus.

B. Presents with rapidly progressive neurologic signs  (visual loss, weakness, dementia) 

leading to  death

VI. CENTRAL PONTINE MYELINOLYSIS

A. Focal demyelination of the pons (anterior brain stem)

DEMENTIA AND DEGENERATIVE  DISORDERS 

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Characterized by loss of neurons within the gray matter; often due  to  accumulation 

of protein which damages neurons

Www.Medicalstudyzone.comCentral Nervous System Pathology 

189

B. Degeneration of the cortex leads to  dementia.
C. Degeneration of the brainstem and basal ganglia leads to movement disorders.

II. ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD) 

A. Degenerative disease of cortex; most common cause of dementia
B. Clinical features

1. Slow-onset memory loss (begins with short-term memory loss and progresses to 

long-term memory loss) and progressive disorientation

2. Loss of learned motor skills and language
3. Changes in behavior and personality
4. Patients become mute and bedridden; infection is a common cause of death.
5. Focal neurologic deficits are not seen in early disease.

C. Most cases  (95%)  are sporadic and seen in the elderly. 

1. Risk increases with age (doubles every 5 years after the age of 60). 
2. ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is associated with increased risk, ε2 allele

with decreased risk.

D. Early-onset AD is seen in 

1. Familial cases - associated  with presenilin  1 and presenilin 2 mutations
2. Down syndrome - commonly occurs by 40 years of age

E. Morphologic features include

1. Cerebral atrophy with narrowing of the gyri, widening of the sulci, and dilation

of the ventricles (Fig.  17.12A) 

2. Neuritic plaques - extracellular core comprised of Aβ  amyloid with entangled

neuritic processes (Fig. 17.12B) 
i. Aβ  amyloid is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is coded 
on chromosome 21. APP normally undergoes alpha cleavage; beta cleavage
results in Aβ  amyloid.

ii. Amy lo id  may also deposit around vessels, increasing the risk of hemorrhage.

3. Neurofibrillary tangles - intracellular  aggregates of fibers composed of

hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Fig.  17.12C) 
i. Tau  is a microtubule-associated protein.

4. Loss of cholinergic neurons in  the nucleus basalis of Meynert

F. Diagnosis is made by clinical and pathological correlation.

1. Presumptive diagnosis is made clinically after excluding other causes.
2. Confirmed by histology at autopsy (when possible)

III. VASCULAR DEMENTIA

A. Degeneration of GABAergic neurons in the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia (Fig.

17.14)
1. Autosomal dominant disorder (chromosome 4) characterized by expanded

trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in the huntingtin gene

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

1.  Most common tumors in children  are pilocytic astrocytoma, ependymoma, and

medullo blastoma.

F.  Primary malignant CNS tumors are locally destructive, but rarely metastasize.

II. GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME (GBM) 

A. Malignant, high-grade tumor of astrocytes
B. Most common primary malignant CNS tumor in adults
C. Usually arises in the  cerebral hemisphere; characteristically crosses the  corpus 

callosum ('butterfly' lesion, Fig.  17.16A) 

D. Characterized by regions of necrosis  surrounded by tumor cells (pseudopalisading, 

Fig.  17.16B)  and endothelial cell proliferation; tumor cells  are GFAP positive.

E. Poor prognosis

III. MENINGIOMA

A. Benign tumor of arachnoid cells
B. Most common benign CNS tumor in adults

1. More  commonly seen in women; rare in children

C. May present as  seizures; tumor compresses, but does not invade, the cortex.
D. Imaging reveals a round mass attached to  the dura.
E. Histology shows a whorled pattern (Fig.  17.17); psammoma bodies may be present.

IV. SCHWANNOMA

A. Benign tumor of Schwann cells
B. Involves cranial or  spinal nerves; within the cranium, most frequently involves 
cranial nerve VIII at the cerebellopontine angle (presents as  loss of hearing and 
tinnitus)

C. Tumor cells  are S-100+.
D. Bilateral tumors are seen in neurofibromatosis type 2. 

V. OLIGODENDROGLIOMA

A. Malignant tumor of oligodendrocytes
B. Imaging reveals a calcified tumor in  the white matter, usually involving the frontal 

lobe; may present with seizures
'Fried-egg' appearance of cells  on biopsy (Fig.  17.18) 

C.

VI. PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA

A. Benign tumor of astrocytes
B. Most common CNS  tumor in children; usually arises in the cerebellum
C. Imaging reveals a cystic lesion with a mural nodule  (Fig.  17.19A).
