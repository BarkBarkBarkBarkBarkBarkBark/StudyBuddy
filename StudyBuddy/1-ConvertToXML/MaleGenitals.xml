    Male Genital System


PENIS
I. HYPOSPADIAS

A. Opening of urethra on  inferior surface of penis
B. Due to  failure of the urethral folds to  close

II.  EPISPADIAS

A. Opening of urethra on  superior surface of penis
B. Due to  abnormal positioning of the genital tubercle
C. Associated with bladder exstrophy

III. CONDYLOMA ACUMINATUM

A. Benign warty growth on  genital skin
B. Due to HPV type 6 or  11; characterized by koilocytic change (Fig.  14.1) 

IV. LYMPHOGRANULOMA VENEREUM

A. Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the inguinal lymphatics and lymph 

nodes

B. Sexually transmitted disease caused by Chlamydia  trachomatis (serotypes L1-L3)
C. Eventually heals with fibrosis; perianal involvement may result in rectal stricture.

V. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

A. Malignant proliferation of squamous cells of penile skin
B. Risk factors

1. High risk HPV (2/3  of cases) 
2. Lack of circumcision - Foreskin acts as  a nidus for inflammation and irritation 

if not properly maintained.

C. Precursor in situ lesions

1. Bowen disease - in situ carcinoma of the penile shaft or scrotum that presents as 

leukoplakia

2. Erythroplasia of Queyrat - in situ carcinoma on  the glans that presents as 

erythroplakia

3. Bowenoid papulosis - in situ carcinoma that presents as  multiple reddish papules
Seen in younger patients (40s)  relative to  Bowen disease and erythroplasia of 
Queyrat

ii. Does not progress to  invasive carcinoma

I. CRYPTORCHIDISM

A. Failure of testicle to  descend into the scrotal sac

<page number="2">

TESTICLE 

1. Testicles normally develop in the abdomen and then "descend" into the scrotal 

sac as the fetus grows.

B. Most common congenital male reproductive abnormality; seen in  1 % of male infants

FUNDAMENTALS OF PATHOLOGY

C. Most cases resolve spontaneously; otherwise, orchiopexy is  performed before 2 years

of age. 

D. Complications include testicular atrophy with infertility and increased risk for 

seminoma.

II. ORCHITIS

A. Inflammation of the testicle
B. Causes

1. Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D-K) or Neisseria gonorrhoeae - Seen in young
adults. Increased risk of sterility, but libido is not affected because Leydig cells are
spared.

2. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas - Seen in older adults; urinary tract infection

pathogens spread into the reproductive tract.

3. Mumps virus (teenage males) - increased risk for infertility; testicular

inflammation is usually not seen in children < 10 years old. 

4. Autoimmune orchitis  -  characterized by granulomas involving the

seminiferous tubules

III. TESTICULAR TORSION

A. Twisting of the spermatic cord; thin-walled veins become obstructed leading to

congestion and hemorrhagic infarction (Fig.  14.2). 

B. Usually due to congenital failure of testes to attach to the inner lining of the scrotum

(via the processus vaginalis)

C. Presents in adolescents with sudden testicular pain and absent cremasteric reflex 

IV. VARICOCELE

A. Dilation of the spermatic vein due to impaired drainage
B. Presents as scrotal swelling with a "bag of worms" appearance
C. Usually left sided; left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein, while the right

testicular vein drains directly into the IVC. 
1. Associated with left-sided renal cell carcinoma; RCC often invades the renal vein.

D. Seen in a large percentage of infertile males

V. HYDROCELE

A. Fluid collection within the tunica vaginalis

1. Tunica vaginalis is a serous membrane that covers the testicle as well as the

internal surface of the scrotum.

B. Associated with incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis leading to

communication with the peritoneal cavity (infants) or blockage of lymphatic
drainage (adults)

C.  Presents as  scrotal swelling that can be transilluminated (Fig.  14.3)

TESTICULAR TUMORS 

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Arise from germ cells or sex cord-stroma
B. Present as a firm, painless testicular mass that cannot be transilluminated
C. Usually not biopsied due  to risk of seeding the  scrotum; removed via radical

orchiectomy
1. Most testicular tumors are malignant germ cell tumors.

II. GERM CELL TUMORS

A. Most common type of testicular tumor (>  95% of cases) 
B. Usually occur between  15-40 years of age 
C. Risk factors include cryptorchidism and Klinefelter syndrome.
D. Divided into seminoma and nonseminoma

1. Seminomas (55% of cases) are highly responsive to  radiotherapy, metastasize late,

and have an excellent prognosis.

2. Nonseminomas (45%  of cases) show variable response to  treatment and often 

metastasize early. 

E. Seminoma is a malignant tumor comprised of large cells with clear cytoplasm and

central nuclei  (resemble spermatogonia,  Fig.  14.4A); forms a homogeneous mass with
no hemorrhage or necrosis (Fig.  14.4B) 
1. Most common testicular tumor; resembles ovarian dysgerminoma
2. Rare cases may produce β- hCG. 
3. Good prognosis; responds to radiotherapy

F. Embryonal carcinoma is  a malignant tumor comprised of immature, primitive cells
that may produce glands (Fig.  14.5A); forms a hemorrhagic mass with necrosis  (Fig. 
14.SB) 
1. Aggressive with early hematogenous spread
2. Chemotherapy may result in differentiation into another type of germ cell tumor

(e.g., teratoma).

3. Increased AFP or β- hCG may be present.

G. Yolk sac (endodermal sinus)  tumor is a malignant tumor that resembles yolk sac

elements.
1. Most common testicular tumor in children
2. Schiller-Duval bodies (glomerulus-like structures)  are seen on  histology (Fig. 

14.6). 

3. AFP is  characteristically elevated.

PROSTATE 

I. BASIC PRINCIPLES

A. Small, round organ that lies at the base of the bladder encircling the urethra
B. Sits anterior to  the rectum; posterior aspect of prostate is palpable by digital rectal 

exam (DRE). 

C. Consists of glands and stroma  (Fig.  14.9) 

1. Glands are composed of an inner layer of luminal  cells and an outer layer of 
basal cells; secrete alkaline, milky fluid that is added to sperm and seminal 
vesicle fluid to make semen.

2. Glands and stroma are maintained by androgens.

II. ACUTE PROSTATITIS

A. Acute inflammation of the prostate; usually due  to bacteria

1. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes in young 

adults.

2. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas are common causes in  older adults.

B. Presents as dysuria with fever and chills
C. Prostate is tender and boggy on  digital rectal exam.
D. Prostatic secretions show WBCs; culture reveals bacteria.

III. CHRONIC PROSTATITIS

A. Chronic inflammation  of prostate
B. Presents as  dysuria with pelvic or low back pain
C. Prostatic secretions show WBCs, but cultures are negative.

IV. BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA  (BPH) 
A. Hyperplasia of prostatic stroma and glands
B. Age-related change (present in most men by the age of 60 years); no  increased risk 

for cancer

C. Related to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT) 

1. Testosterone is converted to DHT by 5α   -reductase in stromal cells.
2. DHT acts on  the androgen receptor of stromal and epithelial cells resulting in 

hyperplastic nodules.

D. Occurs in  the central periurethral zone of the prostate
E. Clinical features include

1. Problems starting and stopping urine stream
2. Impaired bladder emptying with increased risk for infection and hydronephrosis 

(Fig.  14.10) 

3. Dribbling

F. Spread to lumbar spine or pelvis is  common (Fig.  14.11C); results in osteoblastic 

metastases that present as low back pain and increased serum alkaline phosphatase, 
PSA,  and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) 

G. Prostatectomy is performed for localized disease; advanced disease is  treated with 

hormone suppression to reduce testosterone and DHT. 

1. Continuous GnRH analogs (e.g., leuprolide) shut down the anterior pituitary 

gonadotrophs (LH and FSH  are reduced).

2. Flutamide acts as a competitive inhibitor at the androgen receptor.
